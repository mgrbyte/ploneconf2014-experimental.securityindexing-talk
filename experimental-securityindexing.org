* TODO The problem
** TODO What is the problem?
*** @@sharing tab - performing operations here can be expensive
*** Complex heirachies compound the problem
***  Depending on number of objects, request can timeout (HTTP 503), or worse, crash the site.
** TODO Next steps?
Who knows?
* TODO Approches
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ARCHIVE:  approaches
  :END:

 Various approaches were attempted:

  - Using PAS groups to represent groups of permissions
  - Implementing a 'shadow tree' as a ZCatalog index
    - https://github.com/netsight/experimental.localrolesindex

* TODO Plone Intranet Project
As part of the Plone intranet project, three Netsight'ers were assigned
to work on the problem:

   - Matt Hamilton [img]
   - Ben Cole [img]
   - Matt Russell [img]

Initial design phase:
 - Whiteboard design
 - Collobarative coding sessions

* TODO Implementation

 Mainly my fault:

* TODO Benchmarks

Benchmarks here.

* TODO Wrapping up
